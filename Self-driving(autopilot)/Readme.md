## Description

An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, and robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.<br>
 This system will generate an angle for steering control and the generation of angles basically depends on the movement of the camera.<br>
 For more accurate results calibration of the camera is required. By which the camera is fixed into a particular angle and the learning rate of the model will increase and also provides an effective output.
