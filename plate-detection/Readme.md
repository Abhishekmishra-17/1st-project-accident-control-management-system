## Description

An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, and robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.<br>
 This system will generate angle for steering control and the generation of angle basically depends on the movement of camera.<br>
 For more accurate result callibration of camera is required. By which camera is fixed into an particular angle and then learning rate of model will increase and also provides an effective output.
