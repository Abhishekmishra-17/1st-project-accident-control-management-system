## Applications
This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents


### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 

### Dependencies

1) import cv2
2) import imutils
3) import dlib
4) import scipy


### Description

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

### Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.

### Condition

It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is less than 0.25, Alert is generated.
