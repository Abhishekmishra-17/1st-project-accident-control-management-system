<b> Project Name | <b> Accident Control Management System
<b> Field |     <b> 1. Machine Learning<br>2. Computer Vision<br>3. Internet of Things

<h5> About the Objective of Project  : </h5>

The main objective of this Accident Control Management System is to provide an efficient system to resolve the most common real world problems which is road accidents.<br>
This system will provides an efficient solution of all possible way of road accidents like drowsy driver, drunk and drive, wrong lane e.t.c.<br>
This system is also includes its negative aspect and try to resolve them.

# Accident Control Management System

<h3>Research Gap and Problems:</h3>
There are lots of models, which proposed the solution for accident control. Some of them are good and some of them are outdated or are not implemented in the real world. The problem in existing system is that<br>1. There is no any solution of hardware failure.<br>2.There is no direct SMS or messaging service.<br>
3. There is no any proposed solution if the model has some failure occure.<br>4. Using Sensors, which are frequently defective due to external environments is not a better option for the future.<br> 5. Each model is works individually that's why they may be not gave a proper and accurate solution.<br> 6. The cost of the existing model is not affordable for common pleople.<br>
