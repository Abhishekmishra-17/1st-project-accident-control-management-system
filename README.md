<h5> About the Objective of Project  : </h5>

The main objective of this Accident Control Management System is to provide an efficient system to resolve the most common real world problems which is road accidents.<br>
This system will provides an efficient solution of all possible way of road accidents like drowsy driver, drunk and drive, wrong lane e.t.c.<br>
This system is also includes its negative aspect and try to resolve them.

<h3>Research Gap and Problems:</h3>
There are lots of models, which proposed the solution for accident control. Some of them are good and some of them are outdated or are not implemented in the real world. The problem in existing system is that<br>1. There is no any solution of hardware failure.<br>2.There is no direct SMS or messaging service.<br>
3. There is no any proposed solution if the model has some failure occure.<br>4. Using Sensors, which are frequently defective due to external environments is not a better option for the future.<br> 5. Each model is works individually that's why they may be not gave a proper and accurate solution.<br> 6. The cost of the existing model is not affordable for common pleople.<br>
   <br>
   <h3> Proposed Solution:</h3>
   For the best solution, it is important to make an analysis on problems, and what we have . we make a proper analysis on every problem and try to resolve them. Our project is also to remove some of its negative aspects, as we thought that no one is perfect. We proposed an integrated system that has inbulit modules with interface.
   Using of minimum number of sensors is leads less number of failure.
   <br>
   <h3>Methodology:</h3>
   Driving is a very sensitive activity that needs to be done very consciously and with high care. One should follow traffic rules and should take all safety precautions while driving on road. Recent studies show how communication capabilities should be supported by an Artificial Intelligence system capable of automating many of the decisions to be taken by emergency services, thereby adapting the resources of the rescue to the severity of the accident and reducing assistance time. The prevention method is the best method for accident avoidance. This project proposes a novel intelligence system, which is able to automatically detect the major factor of a road accident and if one of them is being in action then notify us through alert messages and alarms. Our system will prevent accidents and will notify us to do better action in that situation. This project is a combination of two independent modules, first is the hardware module in which all systems will work together and managed by a master integrated board and the other is the software module.<br>
   
The Most of software part of this system will work on CNN (convolutional neural network). The name "convolutional neural network" indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution. Convolutional networks are a specialized type of neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers.<br>A convolutional neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. In any feed-forward neural network, any middle layers are called hidden because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. In a convolutional neural network, the hidden layers include layers that perform convolutions. Typically this includes a layer that performs a dot product of the convolution kernel with the layer's input matrix. This product is usually the Frobenius inner product, and its activation function is commonly ReLU. As the convolution kernel slides along the input matrix for the layer, the convolution operation generates a feature map, which in turn contributes to the input of the next layer. This is followed by other layers such as pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers.<br>
 Image processing will play an important role for this project because every model is trained on preprocessed model and after preprocessing images are stored in les memory in multidimensional array formate with values 0's and 1's.<br>
   Now let's move to hardware portion, basically it used Arduino Uno as data and power synchronizer. It provide an envirment so that sensors are run correctly. The will give alert messages as per situations.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
The main aim of this system is to construct a smart vehicle system with minimizing the limitations of existing models and also enhancing the security of vehicles and human beings by reducing accidental injuries. Smart vehicle system will entail a speed and other parameters of vehicle sensing mechanism which automatically messages to personal contacts with the details of vehicle position when an accident occurs using the GPS system. By using image processing technology we can produces an accident free enviroment. This model will be useful for less memory space and gives more accurate results. Most of models of this project is use the CNN for processing the images.<br><br>
